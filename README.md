# EdgeGrid for HTTPie

EdgeGrid plugin for [HTTPie](https://github.com/jkbr/httpie).

This library implements an Authentication handler for HTTP requests using the [Akamai EdgeGrid Authentication](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/authenticate-with-edgegrid) scheme for HTTPie.

## Install

To use the library, you need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system.

Then, install the `httpie-edgegrid` authentication handler from sources by running this command from the project root directory:

   ```
   pip install .
   ```

Alternatively, you can install it from PyPI (Python Package Index) by running:

```
pip install httpie-edgegrid
```

## Authentication

You can obtain the authentication credentials through an API client. Requests to the API are marked with a timestamp and a signature and are executed immediately.

1. [Create authentication credentials](https://techdocs.akamai.com/developer/docs/set-up-authentication-credentials).

2. Place your credentials in an EdgeGrid resource file, `.edgerc`, under a heading of `[default]` at your local home directory.

   ```
    [default]
    client_secret = C113nt53KR3TN6N90yVuAgICxIRwsObLi0E67/N8eRN=
    host = akab-h05tnam3wl42son7nktnlnnx-kbob3i3v.luna.akamaiapis.net
    access_token = akab-acc35t0k3nodujqunph3w7hzp7-gtm6ij
    client_token = akab-c113ntt0k3n4qtari252bfxxbsl-yvsdj
    ```

3. Use your local `.edgerc` by providing the path to your resource file and credentials' section header.

   The `--edgegrid-config` argument is optional, as it defaults to `~/.edgerc`.

    ```bash
    http --auth-type=edgegrid --edgegrid-config=<path/to/.edgerc> -a <credentials_section_name>: <METHOD> :/<api_endpoint>
    ```

   Alternatively, you can use an `RC_PATH` environment variable to point to the `.edgerc` resource file. It's equivalent to the `--edgegrid-config` argument.

   ```bash
   export RC_PATH=<path/to/.edgerc>
   ```

## Use

To use the library, provide your credentials section header and the appropriate endpoint information.

```bash
$ http --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: GET :/identity-management/v3/user-profile
```
> **Note:** You can omit the `METHOD` argument. If you don't specify it, HTTPie sets it by default to:
>
> - `GET` for requests without body
> - `POST` for requests with body

For details, see the [HTTPie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/optional-get-and-post).

### Query string parameter

When entering query parameters, pass them as name-value pairs separated with a double equal sign (`==`).

```bash
$ http --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: GET :/identity-management/v3/user-profile \
   authGrants==true \
   notifications==true \
   actions==true
```

For detail on adding query string parameters, see [HTTPie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/querystring-parameters).


### Headers

Enter request headers as name-value pairs separated with a colon (`:`).

> **Note:** You don't need to include the `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers. The authentication layer adds these values.

```bash
$ http --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: GET :/identity-management/v3/user-profile \
   Accept:application/json
```

For detail on setting headers, see [HTTPie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/http-headers).

### Body data

Use the [HTTPie syntax](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/non-string-json-fields) to pass simple JSON data in the request.

```bash
$ http --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: PUT :/identity-management/v3/user-profile/basic-info \
  contractType=Billing \
  country=USA \
  firstName=John \
  lastName=Smith \
  phone=3456788765 \
  preferredLanguage=English \
  sessionTimeOut:=30 \
  timeZone=GMT \
  Content-Type:application/json \
  Accept:application/json
```

You can also use `printf` or `echo -n` to pipe simple data to the request.

```bash
$ printf '{
  "contactType": "Billing",
  "country": "USA",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "phone": "3456788765",
  "preferredLanguage": "English",
  "sessionTimeOut": 30,
  "timeZone": "GMT",
}'| http --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: PUT :/identity-management/v3/user-profile/basic-info \
   Content-Type:application/json \
   Accept:application/json
```

To pass a nested JSON object, see [HTTPie documentation](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/nested-json) for details.

> **NOTE:** When testing or exploring this endpoint, make sure you don't override settings for the dev test user.

### Debug

Use the `--verbose` argument to enable debugging and get additional information on the HTTP request.

```
$ http --verbose --auth-type=edgegrid -a default: GET :/identity-management/v3/user-profile
```

In case of the HTTPie plugin's crash, add the `--traceback` argument to the request. It prints out the request's detailed stack trace. It's useful for [reporting issues](#reporting-issues).

## Run tests in virtual environment

The `venv` module is included in Python 3 by default.

To test in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

1. Initialize your environment in a new directory.

   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv ~/Desktop/myenv

   // Windows
   py -m venv ~/Desktop/myenv
   ```

   This creates a `venv` in the specified directory as well as copies pip into it.

2. Activate your environment.

   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   source ~/Desktop/myenv/bin/activate

   // Windows
   ~/Desktop/myenv/Scripts/activate
   ```

   Your prompt will change to show you're working in a virtual environment, for example:

   ```
   (myenv) jsmith@abc-de12fg $
   ```

3. To recreate the environment, install the required dependencies within your project.

   ```
   pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
   ```

4. Run the tests.

   ```
   // Unix/macOS
   pytest -v

   // Windows
   py -m pytest -v
   ```

5. To deactivate your environment, run the `deactivate` command.

## Troubleshooting

| Error message | Solution |
| ------- | -------|
| `http: error: argument --auth-type/-A: invalid choice: 'edgegrid' (choose from 'basic', 'digest')` | macOS Sierra users have reported this error after the package installation. To fix it, try installing the package using pip. |
| `ImportError: 'pyOpenSSL' module missing required functionality. Try upgrading to v0.14 or newer` | If you get this error, then you're required to install an updated version of `pyOpenSSL`: <br /> <br /> `$ pip install --ignore-installed pyOpenSSL`|
| `ImportError: No module named cryptography` | Starting with HTTPie v0.9.4, the Mac homebrew package is built with python3. If you get this error, then probably you've installed httpie-edgegrid with python2.7 (unsupported). To explicitly install with python3, run: <br /> <br /> `$ pip3 install .` <br /> <br /> Or: <br /> <br /> `$ pip3 install httpie-edgegrid` |
